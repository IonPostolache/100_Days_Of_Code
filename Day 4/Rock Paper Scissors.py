"""Instructions
Make a rock, paper, scissors game.
Inside the main.py file, you'll find the ASCII art for the hand signals already saved to a corresponding variable:
rock, paper, and scissors. This will make it easy to print them out to the console.
Start the game by asking the player:
"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."
From there you will need to figure out:
How you will store the user's input.
How you will generate a random choice for the computer.
How you will compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
And also how you will give feedback to the player."""

####### Debugging challenge: #########
#Try running this code and type 5.
#It will give you an IndexError and point to line 32 as the issue.
#But on line 38 we are trying to prevent a crash by detecting
#any numbers great than or equal to 3 or less than 0.
#So what's going on?
#Can you debug the code and fix it?
